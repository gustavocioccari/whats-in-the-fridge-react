This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## :file_folder: The Project
**What's in the Fridge** was developed to help you stop wasting time thinking about what you will cook. Now you can just put the ingredients you have or you want in your meal and it will show you some options to cook.

## :rocket: Technologies
It was built using React and it consumes the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/) where you can get a key for free.
